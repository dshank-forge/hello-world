# hello-world
This is my first repository; it's part of the Git Hub tutorial.
I am an aspiring software engineer and want to learn as much about programming as possible. It seems like learning Git/version control is an important part of writing software so this is my foray into Github!
I like burritos and sushi. I love to cook.

And now I am editing this file on my local computer!!
